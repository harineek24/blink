### Running Camera in Background Mode

If you want to run the camera without showing any GUI (useful for background monitoring):

**Option 1: Using the shell script (Recommended)**
```bash
./start_camera.sh
```

**Option 2: Using the Python runner**
```bash
python3 run_camera_background.py
```

**Option 3: Direct execution**
```bash
conda activate aeyehealth
python3 engine/faces.py
```

The background mode will:
- Run the camera without displaying any GUI windows
- Print blink detection messages to the console
- Save data to `gui/storage.json` as usual
- Allow you to stop with Ctrl+C

This is perfect for:
- Running the camera while working on other tasks
- Server environments without display
- Automated monitoring setups
